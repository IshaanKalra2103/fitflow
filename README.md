## Project Description

Are you tired of generic workout routines that don't cater to your specific needs? Our website offers a personalized workout recommendation experience like no other. We take into account your current mood, sleep, heart rate, steps, water intake, and calories to recommend workouts that suit your unique requirements.
Our website uses Google's authentication API and Google Fit's API to gather data about your vitals, ensuring that our recommendations are tailored to your current physical state. By simply inputting your current mood, you can access a custom-made workout plan that is designed to help you achieve your fitness goals.
But how do we determine the right workouts for you? We use GPT API, an advanced machine learning algorithm that analyzes your mood and vitals to create a workout plan that's suited to your needs. Our algorithm takes into account not only your current physical state but also your emotional state, creating a workout plan that is both effective and enjoyable.
